== Managing API Contacts


When an APP owner subscribes to an API a contract is created. 
This contract shows agreement between APP owner and API owner.
When you subscribe to an API, API creates an API Access Token. This token allows you to start to consume API.

Contract informations are shown on both API and APP.
